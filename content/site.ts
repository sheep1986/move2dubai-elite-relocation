      "As of June 2025, the migration of private capital from traditional Western hubs to the UAE has reached unprecedented levels. This article explores the 'Statutory Residence Test' (SRT) nuances for UK expats and the immediate benefits of a zero-tax environment.",
      "The core of the attraction remains the 0% personal income tax and 0% capital gains tax regime. For a business owner exiting a venture or a high-level executive, the fiscal difference between London and Dubai is no longer marginal—it is transformative.",
      "We analyze the impact of the 'Clean Break' protocol, ensuring that HNW individuals meet all jurisdictional requirements for a compliant exit from the UK tax net while securing their assets in a 100% growth-oriented environment.",
      "The process begins with understanding your current tax position. UK residents are subject to income tax on worldwide earnings, with rates reaching 45% for additional rate taxpayers. Capital gains tax can reach 28% on residential property and 20% on other assets.",
      "By contrast, UAE residents benefit from complete elimination of these burdens. The savings on a £1 million annual income alone could exceed £400,000—funds that compound significantly over time.",
      "Our team coordinates with specialist UK tax barristers to ensure full compliance with HMRC requirements while maximizing your fiscal advantages in the UAE."

      "Our analysis shows that the integration of AI-driven urban safety and a culture of mutual respect has created a social contract where UHNW families can thrive without the constant burden of private security details.",
      "The UAE's crime rate is among the lowest in the world. Violent crime is virtually non-existent, and property crime rates are a fraction of those in London, New York, or Paris.",
      "For families with children, this translates to a quality of life that cannot be quantified. Children walk to school, play in parks, and develop independence that builds confidence and resilience.",
      "Beyond physical safety, the UAE offers financial security through robust legal frameworks, political stability, and a government committed to long-term prosperity."

This must be fully paid, not mortgaged, at the time of application. Fund investments starting at AED 2 million also qualify.' },

      { question: 'What are the ongoing costs of property ownership?', answer: 'Annual costs include service charges (typically 3-5% of property value), DEWA utilities, and optional property management (8-10% of rental income). There is no annual property tax in Dubai.' },
      { question: 'Can I finance my property purchase?', answer: 'Yes, UAE banks offer mortgages to non-residents at 50-75% LTV depending on your profile. However, for Golden Visa qualification, the AED 2 million threshold must be paid in cash—mortgaged portions do not count.' },
      { question: 'How liquid is Dubai real estate?', answer: 'Dubai has one of the most liquid property markets globally for prime assets. Properties in Palm Jumeirah, Downtown, and Dubai Marina typically sell within 30-90 days at market value.' }

      { question: 'How do double taxation treaties work?', answer: 'The UAE has treaties with over 100 countries, including the UK.
